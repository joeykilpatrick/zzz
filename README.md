# zzz

A tiny AutoHotkey script that prevents your computer from going idle or sleeping by gently moving the mouse every 15 seconds. It’s designed for simplicity and auditability — the entire logic fits in a few lines, so you can review and trust what it does.

## Why zzz?
- **Simple**: One script, no dependencies.
- **Auditable**: Read the source in seconds.
- **Flexible**: Run the `.ahk` file directly or use a precompiled `.exe`.


## Installation

### ✅ Recommended: Run the `.ahk` file
1. Download and install [AutoHotkey v1.1](https://www.autohotkey.com/download/1.1/).
2. Download the file `zzz.ahk` from this repo.
3. Double-click `zzz.ahk`.

### Alternative: Use the precompiled `.exe`
1. Go to [Releases](https://github.com/joeykilpatrick/zzz/releases).
2. Download `zzz.exe`.
3. Run `zzz.exe` directly — no AutoHotkey installation required.


## Compatibility
This script targets **AutoHotkey v1.1**. It will not run on v2 without changes.


## How it works
The script is intentionally tiny and transparent. Open `zzz.ahk` in any text editor to see exactly what it does.
